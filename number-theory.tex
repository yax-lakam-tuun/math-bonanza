\begin{definition}[Natural numbers]
    Natural numbers is the set of all positive integers.
    The symbol \N{} is used to denote them.
    The set can be expressed as
    \begin{equation}
        \N = \{1,2,3,4,5,... \}
    \end{equation}
    The number is zero is not part of the natural numbers.
    All positive integers including zero is denoted by \Nzero{} and can be expressed as
    \begin{equation}
        \Nzero = \N \cup \{0\} = \{0, 1,2,3,4,5,... \}
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Integers]
    Integers are the set of all positive natural numbers, negative numbers and the number zero.
    The symbol \Z{} is used to denote them.
    \begin{equation}
        \Z = \{...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,... \}
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Rational numbers]
    Rational numbers is the set of all fractions.
    The symbol \Q{} is used to denote them.
    A rational number $a \in \Q$ can be expressed by a fraction with 
    two integers $p,q \in \Q$.
    \begin{equation}
        a = \frac{p}{q} \quad q \ne 0
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    $N \subset \Nzero \subset \Z \subset \Q$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Since \Z{} is defined as all integers it also includes all positive integers \N{} and 
    number zero.
    The set \Q{} contains all possible fractions, so it also includes fractions with denominator $1$
    \begin{equation}
        a = \frac{p}{q} = \frac{p}{1} = p \quad p \in \Nzero, q = 1
    \end{equation}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    $\sqrt(2) \notin \Q$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Assume $\sqrt{2} \in \Q$:
    Then, there are two integers $p,q \in \Z$, so that fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ 
    can no longer be shortened.
    Now, every integer $a$ can be expressed by 
    \begin{equation}
        a = 2^k b \quad k \in \Nzero, b \in Z \implies a^2 = (2^k b)^2 = 2^{2k} b^2
    \end{equation}
    So, every squared integer has an even number of 2s.
    However, $2 q^2 = p^2$ implies $p^2$ has odd number of 2s which contradicts the statement 
    that every squared integer has an even number of 2s.
    \begin{equation}
        2 q^2 = p^2 \implies p^2 = 2^{2k+1} b \quad \blitz  \quad k \in \Nzero, b \in \Z
    \end{equation}
\end{proof}
